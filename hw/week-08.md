1. Connect your local git repository to a remote repository on GitHub.  (Follow [GitHub's instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/) to do this!) Push your in-class work to GitHub. If you were working with someone else driving, copy and paste their code from GitHub into your file to continue work after you separate. List collaborator names at the top of your file. 

2. Spend about 30 minutes to an hour working on the following [exercises from the ruby methods notes](https://github.com/sf-wdi-37/ruby-methods/blob/master/exercises.md):

- Looping 1-3 (stretch: add 4-5)
- Array#map 1 (stretch: add 2)
- Methods 1-2
- (stretch: add Enumerable#inject 1-2)

> As you go, practice the [strategies we brainstormed](https://github.com/sf-wdi-37/ruby-methods/blob/master/strategy.md). 

> Commit after you finish each method. Push your work to your GitHub repository when you finish. 

> Save some time to look over [example solutions](https://github.com/sf-wdi-37/ruby-methods/blob/master/example-solutions.md).

3. Work through this [OOP reading](https://github.com/sf-wdi-37/ruby-oop-reading).  It will probably take 1-2 hours. Write down answers to each of the [reflection questions](https://github.com/sf-wdi-37/ruby-oop-reading#reflection-questions) from the bottom of the readme, and **bring your answers in with you tomorrow.**  Tips:
  * If you just read through this, you're not getting the full benefit!  Instead, create a Ruby file to follow along with the code examples and run it every step or two with `ruby your_file_name.rb`.  
  * Try things out! Would it break if I do `car[color]`?  
  * If you're not feeling cars, create an entirely different class following the same examples (plants? phones? baseball players?)!  **Following along in code is a great strategy for reading docs on unfamiliar topics!**  
  * If you want to split this longer reading up a little, good break points are before "Inheritance" and before "Modules".
