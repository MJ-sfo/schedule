# Week 5

The evening trainings and readings below will help you solidify work so far and/or prepare you for the next day's materials.

### Monday

link to submit on [tonight's pulse check](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScicQdZtf2JLFw4O-u618YhNeaJ7sJXVN36ybzO7pnaV359QA/viewform?usp=sf_link): none



1. Fill out the [Project 1 Peer Feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe0136SeqJYqcGWSC9e8GHtI5tuSdBRzgdCih-l_VNerFA__g/viewform?usp=sf_link) to reflect on your team's work in this project. Your answers will be combined with outside observations of your group as part of project feedback (not shared directly with your partner). Please be honest and fair - this is a good way to help your partner improve!  This should take about 5-15 minutes.

2. Complete [Tunely-Angular sprint 1](https://github.com/sf-wdi-37/tunely-angular).  As you work, write down answers to the following questions:

 * How would you describe two-way data binding to someone who had never used angular?
 * What is a controller in Angular? A module?
 * Where do you think angular might be using DOM events behind the scenes?

3. To prepare for using the `$http` service tomorrow, read [the `$http` service documentation](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$http). Specifically, look at the **General Usage**, **Usage - Arguments**, and **Examples** sections.  How does Angular's `$http` service compare to jQuery's `$.ajax` method?
