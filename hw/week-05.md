# Week 5

The evening trainings and readings below will help you solidify work so far and/or prepare you for the next day's materials.


### Monday

link to submit on [tonight's pulse check](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScicQdZtf2JLFw4O-u618YhNeaJ7sJXVN36ybzO7pnaV359QA/viewform?usp=sf_link): none


1. Fill out the [Project 1 Peer Feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe0136SeqJYqcGWSC9e8GHtI5tuSdBRzgdCih-l_VNerFA__g/viewform?usp=sf_link) to reflect on your team's work in this project. Your answers will be combined with outside observations of your group as part of project feedback (not shared directly with your partner). Please be honest and fair - this is a good way to help your partner improve!  This should take about 5-15 minutes.

2. Complete [Tunely-Angular sprint 1](https://github.com/sf-wdi-37/tunely-angular). This will probably be the bulk of the time you spend on Angular tonight. As you work, write down answers to the following questions:

 * How would you describe two-way data binding to someone who had never used angular?
 * What is a controller in Angular? A module?
 * Where do you think angular might be using DOM events behind the scenes?

3. To prepare for using the `$http` service tomorrow, read [the `$http` service documentation](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$http). Specifically, look at the **General Usage**, **Usage - Arguments**, and **Examples** sections.  How does Angular's `$http` service compare to jQuery's `$.ajax` method?  This should take about 30-45 minutes. 


### Tuesday

1. Complete [Tunely Angular sprint 3](https://github.com/SF-WDI-37/tunely-angular/blob/master/docs/sprint3.md)! Take time to explore and review the [`solutions_sprint_3 branch`](https://github.com/sf-wdi-37/tunely-angular/tree/solutions_sprint_3) after you spend 2 hours on sprint 3, you should spend at least 30 minutes with the solutions. Take notes on how your solutions varied from the provided solutions.

2. Go to the [project 1 tab of this google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VUWa61eMVOE0WTUIqfzTX1-6KJhm4YecA7hXg41BP2Y/edit?usp=sharing) and submit your project links! 

3. OPTIONAL - If you would like practice creating an angular app from scratch, try building a site to track movies you want to watch, with an [Angular Movie Lab](https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/angular-movie-lab).


### Wednesday

1. Continue the [Angular Pokemon](https://github.com/sf-wdi-37/angular-pokemon) app.  You should at least aim to complete #1 under [Expectations](https://github.com/sf-wdi-37/angular-pokemon#expectations), but the show page can be minimal (just a header is okay for now).  

2. Go back through Tunely Angular sprints 1-4 and write or diagram the main goal of each sprint as well as how you completed it. Include at least 3 specific steps per sprint and which files you changed. Review solutions for any parts of Tunely Angular sprint 1-4 that were particularly confusing for you. 

### Thursday

link to submit on [tonight's pulse check](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScicQdZtf2JLFw4O-u618YhNeaJ7sJXVN36ybzO7pnaV359QA/viewform?usp=sf_link): your Angular Pokemon Lab

1. Complete the [Cards Against Assembly](https://github.com/SF-WDI-37/angular-custom-directives) app.

2. Continue the [Angular Pokemon](https://github.com/sf-wdi-37/angular-pokemon) app.  Complete #2 under [Expectations](https://github.com/sf-wdi-37/angular-pokemon#expectations), which involves showing a single pokemon on a show page and deleting or editing single pokemon data. 

3. For review, list any apps that you wanted to deploy to Heroku but haven't been able to or are blocked on.

4. Also for review, write down three questions and bring them with you. Be prepared to discuss these with your colleagues!



### Weekend

1. Spend up to one more hour on the [Angular Pokemon](https://github.com/sf-wdi-37/angular-pokemon) lab, commit and push your code, and then carefully read and understand the code on the solutions branch. 

2. Use the Pokémon lab as inspiration to build a new Angular CRUD application from scratch. Instead of CRUDing Pokémon, your resource will be books, which can also be accessed at the [super CRUD API](https://super-crud.herokuapp.com/books). Or try wines! Feel free to reference your prior work and the Angular Pokemon solutions.
