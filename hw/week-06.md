1. Work on the [ATM Lab](https://github.com/sf-wdi-37/atm-react). Use the hints and provided code if you get stuck. Also, spend at least 15 minutes reviewing the solutions branch and comparing it to your work. Take notes on where your code and the solution code vary.

1. Continue working through the [Todo Lab](https://github.com/sf-wdi-37/react-todo-walkthrough-jquery). Use the code provided, but do take the time to "think critically," make notes, and/or draw diagrams about what you are doing.  Set aside 2 more hours to work on the lab and at least 30 minutes to review the solutions branches and comparing that code to your work. Take notes on where your code and the solution code vary.  

2. If you finish the Todo Lab before 2 hours, still invest that time in reviewing React. You can go back over any parts of the Todo Lab that made less sense to you and add comments, or start building the app again in new directory with a different super-crud resource. 



### Wednesday

1. Continue the React OMDB lab for about 2 hours (including solution review time). Reference the solutions for the OMDB lab if you get stuck, and spend at least 15 minutes reviewing the solutions branch after you finish to compare it to your work.




### Thursday

1. Spend one additional hour on the [MERN-CRUD lab](https://github.com/sf-wdi-37/MERN-CRUD-Lab). Whether or not you wrap up within the hour, spend 15-30 minutes looking at the client side of the [solution branch](https://github.com/sf-wdi-37/MERN-CRUD-Lab/tree/solution). 

2. Spend 1 hour building [a GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/) that would help guide you through the opening steps to setting up a React application.
