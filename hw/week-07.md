0. Fill out the [Wayfarer Reflections & Peer Feedback form](https://goo.gl/forms/OJ3jOUFSJ07Z6rh32).

1. Work through [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0), an interactive introduction to Ruby. The whole tutorial is very useful, but at least do levels 1-4.  _Note: despite what the site says, this will take longer than 15 minutes! Plan to spend about 1 hour working throug this and taking notes._

2. Take about 30 minutes (total) skimming through the following 3 free books on Ruby. Spend a little time really reading the table of contents (if there is one) and seeing what piques your interest. 

 - http://poignant.guide/book/chapter-1.html
 - http://humblelittlerubybook.com/book/html/index.html
 - http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/
 
 Choose at least one of these books to read more of, and spend at least 30 minutes reading it and making notes.  Skip ahead to the topics that interested you most based on what you remember from JavaScript. You can always go back to previous chapters later!

 > Another great but non-free book is Practical Object Oriented Design (POODR) by Sandi Metz.  For starting out Ruby, you could focus on chapters 1-3.

3. Use any extra time to go farther with the resources above or check out other resources about Ruby! One possibility is 
[codewars' Ruby language challenges](https://www.codewars.com/?language=ruby).
